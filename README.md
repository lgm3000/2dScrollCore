# 2dScrollCore
A simple try on 2-D scrolling games, with emphasis on:

## 1.Enemy AI behaviour

## 2. Partner AI behaviour
Partner systems are fun to play with (2D:Sonic Advance 3); but the behaviour of its AI is quite a pain in the ass. In this demo we will try to define a partner that will:
* follow main chara
* react to different objects
while
* avoiding hazards
* not negatively affecting player gameplay
* playing weeaboo idle animations

## 3.Testing animations
Animations are based on systmes similar to state machines.
